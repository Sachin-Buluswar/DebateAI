### 5. **Core Functionality Testing**
- ‚úÖ Socket.IO connection verified
- ‚úÖ AI speech generation working
- ‚ùå Debate room event handlers need implementation
- üìù Created test script: `scripts/test-debate-functionality.js`

## üîÑ Remaining Work

### High Priority
1. **Fix Socket.IO Event Handlers** - Mismatch between expected and actual event names
2. **Test Authentication Flow** - End-to-end email verification testing
3. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Optimize UI for mobile devices

### Medium Priority
1. **Production Health Checks** - Enhanced monitoring endpoints
2. **Unit Test Suite** - Comprehensive test coverage
3. **Production Environment Config** - Environment-specific configurations

### Low Priority
1. **Production Deployment Scripts** - Automated deployment tools

## üöÄ Next Steps for Production Deployment

### 1. **Configure Secrets**
Set up all required secrets in GitHub repository settings:
- Supabase credentials
- OpenAI API keys
- ElevenLabs API key
- Monitoring service endpoints

### 2. **Build and Test Docker Image**
```bash
# Build production image
./scripts/docker-build.sh production

# Test locally
./scripts/docker-run.sh production
```

### 3. **Deploy to Production**
1. Push to main branch to trigger CI/CD
2. Monitor deployment in GitHub Actions
3. Verify health checks pass
4. Run smoke tests

### 4. **Enable Monitoring**
1. Configure `MONITORING_ENDPOINT` for log aggregation
2. Set up alerts for errors and performance issues
3. Monitor rate limits and adjust as needed
