## How to Apply Migrations

1. **Manual Application (Recommended)**:
   - Go to your Supabase Dashboard
   - Navigate to SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste each migration file content
   - Execute in order:
     1. `enable_rls_policies.sql`
     2. `add_saved_state_columns.sql`
     3. `create_user_preferences.sql`

2. **Using Script**:
   ```bash
   npm run apply-migrations
   ```

## Security Recommendations

### Enable Additional Auth Security:
1. Go to Authentication > Settings in Supabase Dashboard
2. Enable "Leaked Password Protection"
3. Configure MFA options (TOTP, SMS)
4. Set up email templates for better branding

### Verify RLS Policies:
```sql
-- Check RLS status
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Test policies
SET ROLE authenticated;
SELECT * FROM debate_sessions; -- Should only show user's sessions
```

## Data Being Saved
