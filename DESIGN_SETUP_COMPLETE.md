# ✅ UI/UX Design Setup Complete

## 🎨 5 Distinct Designs Created

I've successfully created 5 different UI/UX designs for DebateAI, each in its own git worktree:

1. **🎮 Modern Competitive** - Esports-inspired with neon cyberpunk aesthetics
2. **📚 Academic Professional** - Traditional scholarly design with formal appeal  
3. **🏆 Gamified Learning** - Achievement-driven with XP bars and rewards
4. **🧘 Minimalist Focus** - Distraction-free, zen-inspired simplicity
5. **⚡ Bold Dynamic** - High-energy with 3D effects and vibrant animations

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

1. **Environment Variables**: Created symlinks to `.env.local` in each worktree
2. **Dependencies**: Installed `node_modules` in each worktree
3. **Port Configuration**: Updated scripts to use `next dev` directly with explicit ports

## 🚀 How to View the Designs

### Option 1: Run All Designs at Once
```bash
./scripts/run-all-designs.sh
```
This will start all 5 designs on different ports:
- Modern Competitive: http://localhost:3001
- Academic Professional: http://localhost:3002
- Gamified Learning: http://localhost:3003
- Minimalist Focus: http://localhost:3004
- Bold Dynamic: http://localhost:3005

### Option 2: Run a Single Design
```bash
./scripts/run-design.sh <design-name>

# Examples:
./scripts/run-design.sh competitive
./scripts/run-design.sh academic
./scripts/run-design.sh gamified
./scripts/run-design.sh minimalist
./scripts/run-design.sh dynamic
```

### Option 3: Manual Start
```bash
cd designs/<design-name>
npx next dev -p <port>
```
