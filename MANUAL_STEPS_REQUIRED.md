# Manual Steps Required

## Git Push

The changes have been committed locally but need to be pushed to GitHub. The push command is timing out from this environment.

**Run this command manually:**
```bash
git push origin main
```

If that fails, try:
```bash
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

## Commit Information

The following commit has been made locally:
- Commit message: "fix: resolve all production deployment issues"
- All critical deployment issues have been fixed
- The project builds successfully without errors

## Vercel Deployment

Once pushed to GitHub, Vercel should automatically:
1. Detect the new commit
2. Start a new build
3. Deploy if successful

## What Was Fixed

1. **PDF Parse Error** - Fixed critical build failure
2. **Supabase Auth** - Migrated to new @supabase/ssr package
3. **Security** - Updated multer to v2.x
4. **Code Quality** - Fixed all ESLint warnings

## Verification

The build has been tested locally and succeeds:
```bash
npm run build  # âœ… Succeeds
```

## Files Changed

- 20 files changed
- 130 insertions(+)
- 184 deletions(-)
- 2 new files created (Supabase utilities)

The application is now ready for production deployment on Vercel.
