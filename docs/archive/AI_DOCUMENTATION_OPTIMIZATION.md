## Optimization Principles Applied

1. **Direct Information Only**
   - What, not why
   - Commands, not explanations
   - Paths, not descriptions

2. **Machine-Readable Format**
   - Consistent structure
   - Clear headers
   - Code blocks with language tags
   - No ambiguous references

3. **Complete Context**
   - Full file paths
   - Complete code examples
   - All imports shown
   - Environment variables listed

4. **Action-Oriented**
   - Every section has actionable output
   - Commands can be executed directly
   - No decision trees or options

## Usage for AI Agents

When working on this codebase:
1. Check `CLAUDE.md` for rules and patterns
2. Use `docs/README.md` as file index
3. Copy patterns exactly from `docs/development/patterns.md`
4. Follow checklist in `docs/deployment/checklist.md`
5. Fix errors using `docs/development/troubleshooting.md`

No interpretation needed. Execute commands as written.
