# DebateAI – Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview & Vision
DebateAI is an AI-powered debate simulation platform designed to provide a realistic, educational, and engaging experience. Users can participate in structured debates with multiple AI-driven participants who present arguments in lifelike speech. The platform aims to cultivate critical thinking and communication skills by immersing users in dynamic debates on a wide range of topics, leveraging advanced AI for argument generation, real-time interaction, and post-debate analysis.

## 2. Objectives and Goals
- **Skill Development:** Help users improve debating skills, critical thinking, and rhetoric through practice against AI opponents in formal debate formats.
- **Multi-Perspective Insight:** Expose users to diverse viewpoints by featuring multiple AI debaters with distinct personas and stances.
- **Realism and Engagement:** Deliver a highly realistic and immersive experience using natural language generation, expressive text-to-speech (TTS), and real-time conversational AI for interactive segments.
- **Accessibility and Convenience:** Provide a safe, accessible, and convenient space for users to practice debate anytime, without needing access to human opponents.

## 3. Key Features and Functional Requirements

- **Detailed Recommendations:** Offers specific suggestions for improvement

### 3.8 Wiki Search (Evidence Module) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **OpenAI Vector Storage** integration for semantic search over debate evidence
- **Retry Logic:** Exponential backoff for reliable search results
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation with user-friendly error messages

### 3.9 Transcript and Post-Debate Analysis ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- A full transcript of the entire debate is generated, labeling each speaker.
- After the debate, an AI Judge/Analyst (powered by GPT-4o) provides:
    - A neutral summary of the key arguments and debate flow.
    - Personalized performance feedback for the user, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
    - Key moments identification and recommendations for skill development.

### 3.10 User Controls and Customization ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Users can select the debate topic and their side (Affirmative/Negative).
- Options to customize AI skill level and persona/voice selection.
- The interface provides clear controls for participation (e.g., a microphone button) and timers to track segment durations.
- Pause/resume functionality for flexible practice sessions.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Latency:** Crossfire responses achieve <2 second latency for AI replies
- **Reliability:** The system remains stable throughout long debate sessions (30-45+ minutes)
- **Scalability:** Supports concurrent users with proper session isolation

### 4.2 Security & Privacy ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Row-Level Security:** All user data protected with Supabase RLS policies
- **Secure Authentication:** Complete auth flows with email verification and OAuth
- **Data Protection:** Encrypted communication and secure API key management
- **Rate Limiting:** Production-ready rate limiting on all API endpoints

## 5. High-Level Architecture ✅ IMPLEMENTED

The system follows a modular, event-driven architecture orchestrated by a central **Debate Session Manager**.
